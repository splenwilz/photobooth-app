**PhotoBoothX Mobile** is a **remote management and monitoring app** for photobooth business owners and managers.

It allows an owner to:

* Monitor **one or many photobooths** in real time
* Track **sales, transactions, and revenue**
* See **hardware health** (printer, camera, payment controller)
* Receive **alerts** for errors or low supplies
* Adjust **booth settings and pricing** remotely
* Manage **credits and operation modes**
* Do all of this from a **mobile phone (iOS & Android)**

Think of it as **“Mission Control” for photobooths** — not a customer-facing app, but an **owner/admin dashboard on mobile**.
